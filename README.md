# Fotag

Assignment 2 for the Spring 2015 offering of CS 349 (User Interfaces) at
the University of Waterloo.

> **Note**: The current offering of CS 349 has changed significantly since
> Spring 2015 (its technology focus is now Java with Swing and Android
> instead of Web), so I can make this public while being reasonably sure
> this won't cause any issues with respect to academic integrity.

Fotag is a single-page web app which can load images from the local file system
(from the `images/` directory), display them, and allow users to name, rate,
and filter them. Settings are preserved across sessions using `localStorage`.

I sank more time (which could have been spent on other courses) into going
above and beyond the requirements with this than I'd like to admit. That said,
this assignment was structured in such a way that that I learned a lot about
implementing MVC and reusable components in a very practical way.
